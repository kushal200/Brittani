                  <ul>
                    <li> You are self employed or a partner in a partnership</li>

                    <li>You own land or property that is being let</li>
                    <li>Your household receives Child Benefit and you have income in excess of £50,000</li>
                    <li>You have income from overseas</li>        
                    <li>You have sold or given an asset away (such as a holiday home or some shares)</li>           
                    <li>You’ve lived or worked abroad or aren’t domiciled in the UK</li>

               <p>Whether you’re just starting out or have been in business for a long time, our Financial Controller can help you meet your VAT responsibilities.

                If you’re just starting out, we can help you decide whether you need to be VAT registered from the outset or not. And we will continue to monitor your situation, so that should it become obligatory for you to register for VAT, we can deal with all of the paperwork for you. In contrast, we will also monitor your position for when we think you are able to and would benefit from deregistering.</p>

                <p>We can assist individuals and businesses with the preparation of their cash flow projections, budgets and business projections as and when required.  A cash flow projection is probably one of the most important management reports as it shows how cash is expected to flow in and out of the business and how much capital investment your business needs. These reports are typically required by lenders when you want to borrow money and can assist in the successful running of your business.

               <h2>Payroll</h2>
               <p>We would be happy to discuss the implications of employing someone. Employment red tape can be intimidating, but we can guide you through the processes, costs, calculations and deadlines- or take care of everything for you!  Meeting your obligations as an employer can be incredibly daunting but our Financial Controller can take away the hassle. We can set up an Employers’ Scheme with HMRC for you and we can advise you of whether employees should be added to the payroll or not and deal with the relevant forms for you. Throughout the year, we will calculate your employees’ net pay and provide you with payslips to pass on to your staff. We can calculate the tax and National Insurance deductions applicable using HMRC-approved software, even if your employees are on sick, paternity or maternity leave. We can also help you to keep track of their holiday entitlement and can file all the starters and leavers forms on your behalf. Late payments of employers’ deductions can now lead to hefty penalties, so we can help you avoid incurring these. We can also prepare your benefits and expenses forms and advice you of any filing requirements or National Insurance that falls due. Benefits and expenses can be a very complicated area and knowing what and where to report can be tricky, but we can relieve you of the burden. We can file all of your year end returns for you with HMRC and provide you with P60s to distribute to your employees.</p>
